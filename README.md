# Bello, Welcome to The Minionese Visualizer

## Purpose
This project aims to make complicated linguistic concepts fun and appealing by illustrating them through the best movie characters ever â€” the Minions. As many know, Minions speak a constructed language with components borrowed from Spanish, English, Hindi, Korean, and many other real-world languages. The fictional origin of their language comes from their millenia-long proximity to humans across cultures, especially villains or particular leaders such as Gru.

This project will use a combination of speech analysis software and scripting to automate the analysis of the vowels and speech patterns of Minions. The data analysis will culminate into an interactive web-based diagram showcasing the complexities of "Minionese".
